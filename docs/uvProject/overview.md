# uvProject
uvProject is a set of tools designed to streamline the UV creation process in Blender.

In some cases it can create completely automatic live UVs. In other cases the same tools can be used to speed up the manual unwrapping process.

- **Oriented UV Projection.** UVs are aligned with object's up axis by default. Ideal for directional textures e.g. bricks, tiles, wood, leaks etc.
- **Stable UV Projection.** Faces Produce deterministic UVs based on their position and normal. This results in stable UVs that don't jump around as the model is updated.
- **Procedural and Manual.** All UV tools can be applied procedurally (as modifiers or nodes) or manually (as edit mesh tools). This means you can unwrap a mesh completely in the 3D viewport without ever opening the UV view.
- **Modular Tools.** Tools can be chained together to create complex UV pipelines. There are several ways to limit which faces each tool affects.
